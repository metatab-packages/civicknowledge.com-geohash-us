# Geohashes for Continential US

This data provides tracts for the continential US, linked to 
4-character geohashes, and a dataset that provides the 
percentage of overlap between them. 

## Caveats

The `gh_in_tract_prop` and  `tract_in_gh_prop` columns in the overlay
file are intended to be used for crosswalks but they don't seem 
to be correct yet.
